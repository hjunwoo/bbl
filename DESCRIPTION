Description: Supervised learning using Boltzmann Bayes model inference,  
  which extends naive Bayes model to include interactions. Enables 
  classification of data into multiple response groups based on a large 
  number of discrete predictors that can take factor values of heterogeneous
  levels. Either pseudo-likelihood and mean field inference can be used 
  with L2 regularization, cross-validation, and prediction on new data.
